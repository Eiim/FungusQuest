Contributing to Fungus Quest is simple! Download the files onto your own computer, make modifications on there as you please. Then submit a pull request to make a new branch to upload the modified code to. From there, you can continue contributing to that branch and submit a merge request for it when it's done so that it may be merged back into the main branch.
If approved by Ethan, you may commit directly to the Master branch, however this is not reccommened in most circumstances.

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Fungus Quest!
